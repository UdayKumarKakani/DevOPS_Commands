### **Steps to Install Docker on a Windows Machine**

#### 1. **Check Windows Version Compatibility**
   Docker Desktop requires Windows 10 or 11 with WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Make sure you have a compatible version:
   - Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 19041 or higher)
   - Windows 11 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (All editions)

#### 2. **Enable WSL 2**
   WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is required for Docker Desktop on Windows.
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable WSL and the Virtual Machine Platform:
     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```

   This will enable WSL 2 and install Ubuntu as the default Linux distribution.

#### 3. **Download Docker Desktop**
   - Go to the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download the Docker Desktop installer for Windows.
   - Run the installer and follow the installation steps.

#### 4. **Configuration**
   - During installation, select the option to enable the **Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V** (it should be selected by default).
   - After installation, Docker Desktop will prompt you to restart the machine.

#### 5. **Verify Docker Installation**
   - Open PowerShell and run the following command to check if Docker is installed correctly:
     ```powershell
     docker --version
     ```
   - You should see the Docker version output.

#### 6. **Run a Test Docker Container**
   - Now you can test Docker by running a simple container like Nginx:
     ```powershell
     docker run hello-world
     ```

   This will pull the "hello-world" image and run a container.
